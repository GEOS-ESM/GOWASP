The subdirectory BufrCheck creates an executable designed to compare the data
in 2 BUFR files, especially a file of created obs and corresponding obs with
errors added. It computes statistics of those differences, including means,
variances, and correlations horizontally, vertically, or between channesl.
These statistics can then be compared with what was specified in the
error-parameter files used to create the error added observations.
