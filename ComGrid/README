common_grid_ana : takes 0.5x0.5deg NR low RES data, puts it on a 0.625x0.5deg
grid and outputs an ana file.  But note that aside from u,v,t,q,ps,phis the 
interpol between longitudinal points may not be appropriate, since the purpose
here is specifically to put only the dynamical fields into a file that can be 
used by some g5das routines that, however, attempt to input other fields also.

common_grid:  0.5x0.5deg NR low RES data, puts it on a 0.625x0.5deg
grid and outputs a netcdf fikle containing only those fields.

The netcdf headers contain minimal information required by most netcdf reading
routines. 

The interpolation in longitude is accomplished using Fourier transforms, with
a spectral truncation to the lower resol. grid.
