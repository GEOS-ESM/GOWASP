    mean of levs above and below and p,z used at data levels
modified 1 means that 1d ROPP (when m_counter_test>0) 
modified 4 means that 1d ROPP and GSI uses field values on data levels rather
    than interfaces (m_counter_test>3)

statistics are in /home/rerrico/GOWASP_3/GPSROTEST/COMP 
all.0.txt compares allNR0p.txt and allBKG0p.txt 
all.1.txt compares allNR1p.txt and allBKG1p.txt 
all.4.txt compares allNR4p.txt and allBKG4p.txt 
The stats are for means and stdvs of  ROPP_NR obs, ROPP_BKG - GSI_BKG, and O-F (ROPP_NR - GSI_BKG)  

These are all for fields at July 11 0Z   #obs = 114000  globally
The lable ".26" refers to results for fields at July 26 0Z  #obs = 139000 globally

test_OUT_3d conatins printout of profile O,O-F,F for one GPS profile from
the 517 3DVAR OSSE run for checking O and F from test program at same
location. This uses the .ods file output for 0Z 7/11. 

--------------------------------

VERY OLD STUFF (details unavailable) 

x_ctl_hr  ! standard GSI and OSSE ROPP hr means z=imp-roc

x_ctl_hzs    ! standard GSI and OSSE ROPP hzs means z=imp-roc-und-zs

These have little difference, so use hzs therafter

x_1d_hzs ! as above but with 1 d calc in ROPP for all levels.
           makes a big diffeence at lower levels

           stdv of diff reduced by 30% for  8> imp > 3

x_1dcon  ! as above but with some constants changed 
          diff in last digit
          rd, grav, eps, eccent.

x_datlev ! use h,p at data levs, T,q not used at interface as averages

x_datlev_N like above plus change kappas for N calc
         very small diff below 14 km
