Changes I made:

First, for obs with no added error:

For satwinds, I increased target count-numbers for Meteosat by approx 1.6 and
Himarawi by about 2. For others, I made minor adjustments of less than
10%. These I did in the kx_table_in_10.rc files in table 1.

For GMI, I went back to computing obs for all locations in the
corresponding real BUFR files, so there is no thinning. Note that unlike other
rad obs types, for most ana periods, the real obs counts in the BUFR files 
are identical.   

For AIRS, I changed the probability params that will affect the numbers of obs
that will be QC-rejected by GSI based on cloud fractions.  This is done by
changing params in the rad_prob_10.rc file. For chans that peaked at low
levels, the latest counts were about 30% too large. I do not know why the
counts for high-peaking or window channels is 2% lower in the latest test but
I also try now to make those obs less QC-affected

For AMSUA I tried addding consideration of low-level cld fractions to create
more QC rejected obs for chans 4-5. I have also had 20% more of those obs in
the OSSEs, but I never tried using the cloud info to create more of an affect,
so i have no idea how it will work. 

ATMS has 10% fewer obs in the latest exp, but I did not try to change this
since its treatment in GSI is complicated by performing averages of nearby
obs.

AVHRR has 2x the number of obs in the OSSE. I have nver worked with this
before and would have to learn more about its peculiarities, like its QC and
what the instrument is supposed to see.
