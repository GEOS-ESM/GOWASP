In m_obs_pert.f90: Subroutine pert_obs

For vertically correlated error fields that are not also horiz correlated,
such as for raobs and gpsro, the correlation pararmeters that must be set 
in the error.V03.rc file (V03 refers to a particular set of params, not a code
version) as follow: 

For GPSRO:
vcorr_dist=      1 400.

The "1" means correlations for a single variable, i.e., bending angle.  The
"400" is the distance in meters over which the correlation drops to 0.1; it is
not the value of L in the expression correl=exp(-0.5*(delta z/L)**2) which is
instead the distance over which the correlation drops to 1/sqrt(e).

For PREPBUFR:
vcorr_dist=      4 1.12 1.05 1.12 1.12

The "4" means 4 values: separate correlations for T, q, u, v, in that order.
The units here are ratios of p between obs at 2 p-levels.  Distance cannot be
used because the wind reports do not have T values and sometimes not z values,
so differences in height between obs cannot be determined. Instead, we use

Corr=exp [a* (log(P1/P2)/log(PR))**2] 

where PR is the value for the vcorr_dist for the chosen field, 
a=log(0.1) and P1/P2 are the P at two P levels. So, the correlation drops to
0.1 when the 2 P values are in the ratio PR or 1/PR. Note this this
formulation is in terms of p only. It would be equivalent to a constant
correlation length in height if the atmosphere were isothermal. 

I will try to check this again, but for now it is how I read the code.
