kx_ipw_plevs and kx_ipw_bparm  in table 3;  see explanation for kx_ipw_...

kx_ipw_... explanation:   
  These all refer to how layers of integated precipitable water (ipw) are  
     defined and used for various kx types and subtypes.   
  Each AMV type and subtype designed to simulate feature tracking based on 
     images of water vapor will consider one or more ipw layers. Each layer is
     defined by a pair of real numbers indicating its top and bottom p in mb.
     The number of separate, perhaps overlapping, layers considered by any and
     and all of the types and subtypes is set as kx_ipw_nlevs. Separate ipw 
     values will be computed for each defined layer.          
  Different AMV types and subtypes may use different sets of ipw values (i.e.,
     different layers or combinations of layers). Also, they may use different
     scalings of ipw values or minimum values of q for determining the 
     vertical location of observations of its considered layers. The number of
     distinct layer combinations, scalings, and minimum q values is set as 
     kx_ipw_itypes. Each specified combination is refered to by an index
     0,1,...,kx_ipw_itypes, with 0 meaning none considered (i.e., for not a 
     WV-based observation). These latter indexes are specified in Table 2 for 
     each kx,ks.                    
  The specific combinations are defined in Table 3 and stored in the array 
     kx_ipw_bparms(1:2,1:kx_ipw_nlevs,1:kx_ipw_types). Its first index refers
     to the two values q-scaling and q-min. These must be defined for each of
     the kx_ipw_nlevs layers as ordered when kx_ipw_plevs was specified (they
     must both be set to 0. for any layers not to be included in this 
     combination. There are kx_ipw_types of combinations that must be defined.
  For example, for kx_ipw_nlevs=2, kx_ipw_plevs=  100. 700. 600. 900. means 
     that ipw will be determined for each of the 2 layers 100<p<700 and  
     600<p<900. Then for kx_ipw_types=4, the combinations
     "1  3.00 .00010 0.  0.", "2 0. 0. 2.00 .0005", "3 3.00 .00020 1. .001", 
     means that for any kx,ks WV type refering to combination 1, only 
     ipw for layer 1 will be considered, with scaling of delta q by a factor 
     of 3. and qmin set to .0001, to combination 2, only ipw for layer 2 will 
     be considered, with scaling of delta q by a factor          
     of 2. and qmin set to .0005 (gnerally the respecive lower and higher 
     values compared to combination 1 because the q values are larger    
     lower in the atmosphere), and combination 3 meaning that this kx,ks  
     type considers 2 different ipw layers, each with its own scaling and 
     q min). Note that although different kx types may refer to the same   
     layers the scaling and q min may need to differ, e.g., if one concerns 
     observations near the poles and the other near the equator, different 
     scaling and qmin m,ay be required because the q field has such different
     magnitudes in the 2 regions. 
  As coded this appears the most general way of specifying which and how 
     layers are to be used for distinct kx,ks.           

Regarding the scaling, values of ipw for this layer will be divided by this 
value. Bining to produce the histogram will be defined for scaled values
between 1 and 0, with scaled values greater than 1 set to 1. (This is required
because, unlike for cloud fractions that are defined between 1 and 0, ipw has
no fixed range. Using the max and min values to define the range along with
equally-spaced bins results in a poorly discerning histogram because
high-valued outliers are determining the spacing). 

Regarding the min q value, the p-level defined for an obs based on ipw will be
defined as the first value of q found that is > this min value when seraching
through the profile p-levels falling in the range of which thi ipw for this
layer is computed. 

Explanation of table 2:

TABLE 2: descriptions for kx, sat id combinations
Column  1: id for the combination; id=1,...,kx_num
Column  2: GSI kx value for this obs type
Column  3: WMO sat id number; 0 if mutiple ids, as for polar orbiters 
Column  4: NC# This is the number following the NC identifier for this obs
           type in the satwind BUFR tables
Column  5: ks=0 means all satellites for this kx are considered together
           ks=1,2,... is an index corresponding to distinct sat id for this 
           kx; such values can be in any order. 
Column  6: nw is value of NCWSM variable in meta-data in BUFR file for this
           sat id.
Column  7: satellite name
Column  8: data type: 1st character either G (for geostationary) or P (polar);
           2nd character either V (AMV from visible clouds), I (AMV from 
           infrared cloubs), B (both visible and IR), or W (for water vapor
	   AMV)
Column  9: 0 if not a WV AMV; otherwise it is the index for the set of kx_ipw_bparms 
           to be used for this set of obs. 
Column 10: satellite location longitude if geostationary; otherwise 999.
Column 11: dx is the minimum horizontal distance between obs allowed (km)
Column 12: fu=1 if probability is function of cloud fraction; 
           fu=2 if probability is function of ipw range in box
Column 13: gd is flag indicating the type of subset grid to consider for the
           NR data:      
           = 3 if the starting index for i is determined as a random  
            value for each time and lat j within the length of the stride, 
            for which the  length in terms of numbers of grid points depends 
            on the cosine of each lat; 
           = 1 if the starting index is set to 1 so that it is the 
            same for all times and lats; 
           = 2 if the starting index will vary randomly with time but not lat.
           This should be set after examining the pattern of real obs
	   locations; i.e., how regular they are in time and space.
Column 14: qsfac= factor to multiply the target counts by in order to
           compensate for a fraction of the simulated obs that will be 
           rejected due to QC in the GSI. This must be estimated by trial
           and error. =1 means no count inflation.
Column 15: flat: for gd<3, use this particular lat to determine what the 
           stride in the grid i-index should be based on dx (the same i-stride
           is then used for obs at all lats) 
Column 16: slev= min solar zenith angle for obs to exist at location; only 
           applies to obs types based on VIS observations only; otherwis set
           to some number less than -90. 
Column 17: torb: for cloud track winds, indicates that that for clouds with
           their tops at leve p<torb, the obs p level is assigned as that of
	   the cloud top; otherwise it is the cloud base.  
Column 18: mcnt: the minimum number of obs required to consider that obs are 
           present in a satlocation area at any NR time considered. If the 
           number of of obs is less than this, it is treated as though no 
           observations should be produced for this region, time, and
	   kx,sat_id pair.
